# Overview

RexburgRestaurants is an android app that shows a majority of the restaurants in Rexburg Idaho. When a marker is clicked a bottom sheet appears with the name of the restaurant and 
a google review about the restaurant.
The purpose of this app was to further explore android development and the Google maps API. More specifically I wanted to explore clickable markers, bottom sheets, and dynamic layouts.

# Future Work

* Add more useful information in the bottom sheet when a marker is clicked.
* Add a feature for users to mark restaurants as having been visited before. From there the user can filter restaurants that have and haven't been visited. Each time the user goes to a restaurant they can log the visit in the app. 
* Overall UI design improvement, including custom markers and curved edges for bottom sheet.
* Use a data base to store restaurant information that is populated into the app.
